## Project Overview

This project demonstrates comprehensive data cleaning and analysis using an IMDb dataset. The notebook explores and analyzes movie title lengths across different years, focusing on cleaning the dataset and breaking down the title lengths into quantile-based summaries.

### Key Objectives:
- **Data Cleaning**: Address missing values, standardize data, and prepare it for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summarize the IMDb dataset by analyzing key trends in movie title lengths over time.
- **Quantile Analysis**: Categorize movies based on title lengths and generate insights for each year.

This project highlights key skills in data cleaning, data wrangling, and statistical analysis using **Pandas**.

## Project Motivation

With the IMDb dataset, the goal was to:
- Clean and preprocess the data for better analysis.
- Analyze movie title lengths over the years.
- Understand patterns and distributions using quantile calculations (25%, 50%, 75%).
  
This analysis helps understand how title lengths have evolved over time and provides insight into the structure of movie titles.
